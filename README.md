A simple Servo controller in [GO](https://golang.org/) using the [EMBD library](https://github.com/kidoman/embd) to drive the [PCA9685 controller](https://www.adafruit.com/products/815).

This servo program was tested using a setup with a Raspberry Pi Zero and TGYS901D servos controlled by a PCA9685.

The project is built using [GB](https://getgb.io/). See [build4arm.sh](build4arm.sh).
